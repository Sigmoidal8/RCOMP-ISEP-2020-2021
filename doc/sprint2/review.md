## Review of Sprint 1
 * We acknowledged the issue we had in not representing the range of the Access Points on sprint 1.
 * We acknowledged the issue we had, in that we should have put the Access Points in a more central placement.
 * We acknowledged the issue we had in Building 2 in which the second CP should be connected to the CP closest to the HC.
 * We acknowledged the issue we had in Building 4 in which the outlets should have been placed on the suspended communications cable raceways.  
 * We acknowledged the issue we had in Building 1 in which the HC should have been put in the room 11.2 in place of the CP.
