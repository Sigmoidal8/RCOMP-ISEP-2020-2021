RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 3 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1190986 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
In this sprint, each team member will keep working on the same network simulation from the previous sprint (regarding the same building). From the already established layer three configurations, now OSPF based dynamic routing will be used to replace static routing used previously.

Beyond OSPF based dynamic routing, other configurations encompassed in this sprint are:

* DHCPv4 service
* VoIP service
* Adding a second server to each DMZ network to run the HTTP service.
* Configuring DNS servers to establish a DNS domains tree.
* Enforcing NAT (Network Address Translation).
* Establishing traffic access policies (static firewall) on routers.

**Tasks**
  * T.3.1 Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1.
  * T.3.2 Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2.
Final integration of each member’s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation.
  * T.3.3 Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3.
  * T.3.4 Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 4.

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #


  * Os ips dos servers são o segundo e o terceiro disponíveis na gama DMZ
  * Numeros de Telefone:
    * Edifício 1: 1001/1002
    * Edificio 2: 2001/2002
    * Edificio 3: 3001/3002
    * Edificio 4: 4001/4002

# 3. Subtasks assignment #

* 1190780 - Edifício 1
* 1190986 - Edifício 2
* 1191091 - Edifício 3
* 1190778 - Edifício 4
